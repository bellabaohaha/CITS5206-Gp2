| **Spoofing**            | An attacker could spoof the identity of the farmer or the John Deere Platform login interface, tricking the farmer into providing login credentials.    | Unauthorized access to the John Deere Platform could lead to control over the IoT system and sensitive data.               | High           | **Mitigate** - Ask the farmer to enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for added security.                                                                                 | **Current Phase**         |
| **Tampering**           | An attacker could physically access the IoT devices and tamper with the data before it is sent to the cloud.                                            | Altered sensor readings could result in incorrect soil moisture data, leading to poor crop management.                     | Medium         | **Mitigate** - Use tamper-evident enclosures for physical devices and employ data integrity checks to detect unauthorized modifications.                                       | **Future Phase**                     |
| **Repudiation**         | A farmer or attacker could deny having sent specific commands or accessed certain data within the John Deere Platform.                                  | Lack of accountability could complicate troubleshooting and auditing.                                                      | Low            | **Mitigate** - Ensure comprehensive logging and require user consent for actions.                                                                                              | **Future Phase**                     |
| **Information Disclosure** | Sensitive information could be leaked during transmission between IoT systems, Internet Gateway, Cloud Provider, or John Deere Platform.               | Disclosure of sensitive data could lead to privacy violations and competitive disadvantages.                               | High           | **Mitigate** - Use OAuth 2.0 to prevent MITM attacks, and employ strong encryption protocols (e.g., TLS) for secure data transmission.                                        | **Current Phase**         |
| **Denial of Service (DoS)** | An attacker could flood the Internet Gateway or LoRa communication channel with excessive traffic, disrupting the flow of data.                        | Disruption could prevent real-time soil moisture data collection, leading to delayed or incorrect farming decisions.       | Medium         | **Transfer** - Employ a third-party DDoS protection service.                                                                                                                    | **Current Phase**  |
| **Elevation of Privilege** | An attacker could exploit a vulnerability in the John Deere Platform to gain unauthorized administrative privileges.                                   | Disruption of operations or access to sensitive data.                                                                      | Low            | **Mitigate** - Apply strict access control, regularly patch vulnerabilities, and enforce the principle of least privilege.                                                     | **Current Phase**         |
