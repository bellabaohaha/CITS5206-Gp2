# Preliminary STRIDE Analysis

### Approach and Considerations

We conducted a STRIDE Analysis with a focus on breadth rather than depth, as we are in our project planning phase.

We segmented our analysis based on two key attributes, first attribute is Risk level based on impact of a vulnerability being exploited i.e. criticality of system component and asset value and likelihood of occurrence. Our second attribute is based on when we need to actually ensure the threat is addressed and tested. 

Although our client has not made security their priority, we will provide them the STRIDE analysis with our recommendations so that threats out of our control in our System Design this phase such as Spoofing or Physical Tampering are communicated. Our client can decide on whether they want to resolve this issue and if it's a priority for their needs.

As seen in our solution component diagram and description of our solution, we plan on implementing good communication methods for data in transit such as using MQTT, HTTPS and OAuth 2.0 and secure long-term storage on AWS Cloud Platform.

### Stride Analysis

| **STRIDE Category**     | **Threat**                                                                                                                                             | **Impact**                                                                                                                 | **Risk Level** | **Mitigation Strategy**                                                                                                                                                       | **When to Address/Test**               |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Spoofing**            | An attacker could spoof the identity of the farmer or the John Deere Platform login interface, tricking the farmer into providing login credentials.    | Unauthorized access to the John Deere Platform could lead to control over the IoT system and sensitive data.               | High           | **Mitigate** - Ask the farmer to enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for added security.                                                                                 | **Current Phase**         |
| **Tampering**           | An attacker could physically access the IoT devices and tamper with the data before it is sent to the cloud.                                            | Altered sensor readings could result in incorrect soil moisture data, leading to poor crop management.                     | Medium         | **Mitigate** - Use tamper-evident enclosures for physical devices and employ data integrity checks to detect unauthorized modifications.                                       | **Future Phase**                     |
| **Repudiation**         | A farmer or attacker could deny having sent specific commands or accessed certain data within the John Deere Platform.                                  | Lack of accountability could complicate troubleshooting and auditing.                                                      | Low            | **Mitigate** - Ensure comprehensive logging and require user consent for actions.                                                                                              | **Future Phase**                     |
| **Information Disclosure** | Sensitive information could be leaked during transmission between IoT systems, Internet Gateway, Cloud Provider, or John Deere Platform.               | Disclosure of sensitive data could lead to privacy violations and competitive disadvantages.                               | High           | **Mitigate** - Use OAuth 2.0 to prevent MITM attacks, and employ strong encryption protocols (e.g., TLS) for secure data transmission.                                        | **Current Phase**         |
| **Denial of Service (DoS)** | An attacker could flood the Internet Gateway or LoRa communication channel with excessive traffic, disrupting the flow of data.                        | Disruption could prevent real-time soil moisture data collection, leading to delayed or incorrect farming decisions.       | Medium         | **Transfer** - Employ a third-party DDoS protection service.                                                                                                                    | **Current Phase**  |
| **Elevation of Privilege** | An attacker could exploit a vulnerability in the John Deere Platform to gain unauthorized administrative privileges.                                   | Disruption of operations or access to sensitive data.                                                                      | Low            | **Mitigate** - Apply strict access control, regularly patch vulnerabilities, and enforce the principle of least privilege.                                                     | **Current Phase**         |

### Conclusion
We will review the diagram again at a later stage in the project for our individual assessment. Reviewing our preliminary STRIDE analysis will be helpful as our System Components may change. 

Ultimately, as IoT devices are resource constrained, implementation of robust information security techniques listed in [OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process) in our design is limited. We also considered other constraints out of our control such as $0 budget that limits our ability to solve certain issues using the most effective methods such a third party Denial of Service Protection or Physical Security Housing for devices to ensure IoT devices are secure.
