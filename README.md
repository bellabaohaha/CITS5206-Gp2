# CITS5206-Gp2

The team predominantely used [Github Projects (Issues)]([url](https://github.com/bellabaohaha/CITS5206-Gp2/projects?query=is%3Aopen)) to document the provisioning, development, and testing of the solution as this was predominantly a hardware and cloud based project to keep the documentation consistent and source of information centralised. A client demonstration was completed and a report was created and sent to the client directly.
